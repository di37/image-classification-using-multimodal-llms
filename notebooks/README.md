# Notebooks folder -`notebooks`

**Purpose:**  
This folder contains Jupyter notebooks that showcase the entire workflow of the project, from data gathering to final evaluation. They provide a step-by-step, interactive environment for exploration, visualization, and iterative development.

**Notebooks:**

1. **01_Data_Gathering_And_Sampling.ipynb**:  
   Details how the original dataset (90 animals × 60 images each) is reduced to a chosen subset of 10 animals × 25 images each.

2. **02_Image_Classification.ipynb**:  
   Demonstrates how images are fed into different models (open-source and closed-source) to generate classification predictions. This notebook was used like scratchpad to create image classifier functions for later use. The final functions are used in `classify.py` in the root directory.

3. **03_Data_Normalization_of_Outputs.ipynb**:  
   Shows how raw outputs from certain models are normalized or cleaned to correct misspellings and formatting issues, ensuring fair metric comparisons. This was done for open-source models.

4. **04_Models_Evaluation.ipynb**:  
   Conducts final metric calculations - accuracy, precision, recall, f1, inference time plots & confusion matrix plots.

**How to Use:**
- Run these notebooks in sequence to replicate the entire pipeline.
- Modify parameters or code cells as needed to experiment with different models, subsets, or evaluation strategies.

**Notes:**
- Ensure you have the required dependencies installed (`requirements.txt` or environment setup).
- Back up results and figures generated by the notebooks for reporting or publication.
